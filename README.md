# Crisis OS 🚨

### Offline-First Mesh Communication System for Android

Crisis OS is a real-time, offline-first Android communication system designed for scenarios where traditional internet connectivity is unavailable or unreliable. The application enables peer-to-peer messaging using device-to-device mesh networking, allowing users to discover nearby devices, establish connections, and exchange messages without relying on centralized servers, cellular networks, or Wi-Fi infrastructure.

This project demonstrates a robust implementation of Clean Architecture in a real-world Android application, integrating low-level networking, reactive state management, and modular system design.

## 📌 Overview

In emergency situations such as natural disasters, remote expeditions, or network outages, communication becomes a critical challenge. Crisis OS addresses this problem by leveraging the Nearby Connections API to create a decentralized mesh network between Android devices.

Each device acts as both a client and a relay node, enabling message propagation across multiple peers. This allows communication to extend beyond direct Bluetooth or Wi-Fi range through multi-hop transmission.

## 🏗 Architecture

The project follows a layered Clean Architecture model, ensuring clear separation between business logic, data handling, and presentation.

### 🔹 UI Layer

* Built with Jetpack Compose
* Contains ViewModels and Composable screens
* Responsible only for rendering state and handling user input

### 🔹 Domain Layer

* Contains business logic and core models
* Defines repository interfaces
* Includes use cases that represent application actions

### 🔹 Data Layer

* Implements repository interfaces
* Handles data sources (local database + mesh communication)
* Maps between DTOs, entities, and domain models

### 🔹 Device Layer

* Contains Android-specific implementations
* Handles hardware interactions (networking, permissions, services)
* Encapsulates platform-dependent logic

---

## 🔄 Data Flow

1. User sends a message from UI
2. ViewModel triggers a UseCase
3. UseCase calls Repository interface
4. Repository interacts with:

   * Local database (for persistence)
   * Mesh layer (for transmission)
5. Message is propagated to nearby devices
6. Incoming messages are captured via event system
7. Data is stored and UI updates reactively

## 📱 Application Flow

### 1. App Initialization

* Mesh services start in background
* Device begins advertising and discovering peers

### 2. Peer Discovery

* Nearby devices appear dynamically
* Users can view available connections

### 3. Connection Establishment

* Devices connect directly or through mesh
* Connection state is tracked in real-time

### 4. Messaging

* Messages are created and stored locally
* Sent through mesh network
* Received messages are persisted and displayed instantly

## 🔒 Design Principles

* **Offline-first approach** — functionality does not depend on internet
* **Separation of concerns** — each layer has a single responsibility
* **Scalability** — easy to extend with new features
* **Testability** — domain logic is independent of Android framework
* **Maintainability** — modular and organized codebase
